iCATA is a realtime iOS app for CATA bus locations and schedules. It was created for a school project and is not and will not ever be on the iTunes App Store. In fact, don't expect it to be maintained in the future as the author has no interest in furthing its development.

### Features

* Ability to create route groups
* Highlight stop closest to the user's location
* Skip directly to the user's most common route or group on app start
* Show notification when bus is approaching the user's location
* See direction of buses directly on map
* View bus info such as number of people on board, direction, and time by tapping on bus.
* Show bus schedule for individual stops
